Hey there! This is my personal website that's (always) a work in progress. I moved all the code to Github for better management but you'll see it's just built in vanilla HTML/CSS with a tiny bit of JS thrown in.

I plan to work on it more in the future (mostly simple stuff, using the Skeleton framework) since I wanted my site to stay simple and responsive. I might add a portfolio and blog in the near future. 

If there are any issues with it, please message me and let me know!
